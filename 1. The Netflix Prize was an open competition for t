1. The Netflix Prize was an open competition for the best collaborative filtering algorithm to predict user ratings for films.

2. It was an open contest for developeres to showcase their skills and improve netflix recommender system.

3. Prizes were based on improvement over Netflix's own algorithm, called 'Cinematch', or the previous year's score if a team has made improvement beyond a certain threshold.

4. Cinematch uses "straightforward statistical linear models with a lot of data conditioning."

5. It was a progressive contest, whose final winning verdict was announced on June 26, 2009 to the team "BellKor's Pragmatic Chaos," a merger of teams "Bellkor in BigChaos" and "Pragmatic Theory," achieved a 10.05% improvement over Cinematch.

6. On September 18, 2009, Netflix announced team "BellKor's Pragmatic Chaos" as the prize winner



Word Embeddings in NLP
Machine Learning algorithms and almost all Deep Learning Architectures are not capable of processing strings or plain text in their raw form. 

they require numerical numbers as inputs to perform any sort of task, like classification, regression, clustering, etc.

So to build any model in machine/deep learning, the final level data has to be in numerical form because models donâ€™t understand text or image data directly as humans do.

	Bag Of Words
	This Text Vectorization technique converts text content to numerical feature vectors. Bag of Words takes a document from a corpus and converts it into a numeric vector by mapping each document word to a feature vector for the machine learning model.
	It incorporates:

	Tokenization
	Vectors Creation


Cosine Similarity
Cosine similarity is a metric used to determine how similar the documents are irrespective of their size.

Mathematically, It is  the cosine(angle) between 2 vectors projected in n-dimensional space.

It is used to find similarity of objects to a given object (movie).
